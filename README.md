1. **User Interaction with Sangrakshak Interface (Frontend)**
   - **Data Capture**: As a user interacts with the Sangrakshak portal (Aadhaar or other), the frontend components (built using **React** and **JavaScript**) capture various user behavior metrics, such as:
     - Linear movement of the mouse
     - Click count and multi-click events
     - Scrolling rates and rapid scroll events
     - Session time and activity gaps
     - Mouse movement variance
   - **Real-Time Analysis**: Environmental parameters (e.g., screen size, interaction timing) are also collected, making data unique for every user session.

2. **Data Preprocessing (Frontend to Backend Communication)**
   - **Data Transmission**: The collected data is transmitted to the backend via **RESTful APIs**, ensuring secure communication.
   - **Data Normalization and Standardization**: Using **Scikit-Learn**, data preprocessing occurs to ensure that inputs conform to the expected formats for model predictions.

3. **Machine Learning Model Prediction (Backend)**
   - **Data Analysis**: The preprocessed user activity data is fed to the trained detection model created using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. 
   - **Bot Detection**: The model evaluates patterns and detects potential bot-like behavior using sophisticated neural networks. The prediction (0 for Human, 1 for Bot) is returned as output.
     - The detection process leverages data such as historical patterns, time gaps, scrolling behavior, and click metrics.

4. **Decision Handling and Alert System**
   - **Secure Session Handling**: Based on the prediction:
     - **Legitimate User (No Suspicious Activity)**: Displays a green indicator, ‚Äú**Account Secured**.‚Äù
     - **Bot-Like Behavior Detected (Suspicious Activity)**: The system flags the session and displays a red alert, ‚Äú**Suspicious Activity Detected ‚Äì Account Session Terminated**,‚Äù while logging the event for future analysis.
   - **Real-Time Communication**: If real-time data handling is required, **Node.js** can be employed to ensure instantaneous responses and alerts.

5. **Data Storage and Logging**
   - **Storing Interaction Data**: Captured data and detection outcomes are stored in **MySQL** (or **MongoDB** for unstructured data) for record-keeping and model retraining.
   - **User Privacy and Security Measures**: All user data is secured through **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication and **Data Obfuscation** methods.

6. **Continuous Model Improvement and Monitoring**
   - **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**: System performance and detection accuracy are monitored using tools like **Prometheus** and the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to ensure optimal operation and quick adaptation to new threats.
   - **Retraining**: Periodic retraining of the model using new data helps keep the detection mechanism up-to-date against evolving bot behaviors.
